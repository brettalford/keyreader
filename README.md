# keyreader
Downloading strange things from the internet can be dangerous, here we have a simple keyboard input reader that reads input from the users keyboard and mouse and stores it in a text file, the contents of which are emailed via python smtp to an email account but which appears to be nothing more than a simple chill windowed image. The goal of this project is to get used some systems and concepts I haven't had much chance to use such as smtplib and combining that with something that demonstrates my interest in cybersecurity. Because of its potential for misuse the launcher requires a password but if you want to look at the code the documentation should point you towards making it on your device.
