# keyreader
Downloading strange things from the internet can be dangerous, here we have a simple keylogger that reads input from the users keyboard and mouse and stores it in a text file, the contents of which are emailed via python smtp to an email account but which appears to be nothing more than a simple chill windowed image. The goal of this project is to get used some systems and concepts I haven't had much chance to use such as smtplib and combining that with something that demonstrates my interest in cybersecurity.
