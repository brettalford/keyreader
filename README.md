# keyreader
a simple keylogger that reads input from the users keyboard and mouse and stores it in a text file, the contents of which are emailed via python smtp to an email account. The goal of this project is to get a better handle on some systems and concepts I haven't had much chance to use such as smtplib and combining that with something interesting such as a keylogger for entertainments sake.
